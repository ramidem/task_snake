# task_snake

This whole REST API was created using ChatGPT as my way of learning Python

---

## TODOs

These were provided by ChatGPT and I decided to turn them into a to do list to be implemented in this app.

- [x] Implement resource-based routing: Map each resource to a specific endpoint, such as "/tasks" for a list of tasks.
- [x] Implement HTTP methods: Implement different HTTP methods, such as GET for retrieving a resource, POST for creating a resource, PUT for updating a resource, and DELETE for deleting a resource.
- [x] Implement JSON format for requests and responses: Make sure requests and responses are in JSON format and use the Flask `jsonify` function for returning JSON responses.
- [ ] Implement error handling: Implement proper error handling to handle unexpected conditions, such as database errors, invalid input, and authentication failures.
- [x] Integrate with a database: Use a database to store the API data and integrate it using ~~SQLAlchemy~~ sqlite3.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization: Implement OAuth, JWT, or session-based authentication to secure the API.
- [ ] Implement API versioning: Implement API versioning to maintain backward compatibility when making changes to the API. The API version can be included in the endpoint URL, such as "/v1/tasks".
